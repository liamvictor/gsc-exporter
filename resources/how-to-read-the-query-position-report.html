        <h1>How to Read the Query Position Distribution Report</h1>
        <p>This report provides a detailed breakdown of your Google Search Console performance by query position ranges, offering a more granular view than just average position.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Position Ranges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positions 1-3 (Top 3):</strong> These queries rank in the very top of the search results, typically appearing above the fold on the first page. High clicks and impressions in this range indicate strong visibility and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Positions 4-10:</strong> Queries in this range still appear on the first page of search results, but further down. While they receive fewer clicks than the top 3, they are still highly valuable.</li>
            <li><strong>Positions 11-20:</strong> These queries typically appear on the second page of search results. While clicks and impressions are significantly lower, they represent opportunities for improvement to reach the first page.</li>
            <li><strong>Positions 21+:</strong> Queries ranking beyond the second page. These usually yield very low traffic but highlight long-tail opportunities or areas needing significant SEO effort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interpreting the Data</h2>
        <p>For each site and month, you will see clicks and impressions distributed across these ranges. This allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identify Strengths:</strong> See which sites or months have a high proportion of clicks/impressions in the top position ranges.</li>
            <li><strong>Spot Opportunities:</strong> Look for sites with a significant number of impressions in positions 4-10 or 11-20, as these may be good candidates for optimisation to push them into higher ranks.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Trends:</strong> Observe how the distribution changes over time. Are more queries moving into higher positions, or are they slipping?</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Prioritise SEO efforts based on where the most potential traffic gains can be made (e.g., focusing on queries from 4-10 to get them into the top 3).</li>
        </ul>
