        <h1>How to Read the Pages & Queries Report</h1>
        <p class="lead">This report, generated by <code>gsc-pages-queries.py</code>, provides a powerful, two-way view of your site's performance, showing exactly which queries lead to which pages, and vice-versa.</p>

        <h2>Report Structure</h2>
        <p>The report is organized into two main tabs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Queries to Pages:</strong> This view lists all the search queries that your site ranked for in the selected period.</li>
            <li><strong>Pages to Queries:</strong> This view lists all the pages on your site that received impressions in search results.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Both tabs use an interactive accordion. The main entries (either queries or pages) are sorted by the total number of clicks they received. The data tables within each section are formatted for clarity, with right-aligned numeric columns and thousands separators on large numbers to make them easier to read.</p>

        <h2>Queries to Pages Tab</h2>
        <p>This tab helps you understand the user intent behind search queries and which pages on your site are meeting that intent.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Entry:</strong> Each item in the accordion is a search query. The badges show the total clicks and impressions for that query across all pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanded View:</strong> When you click on a query, it expands to show a table of all the pages that appeared in search results for that query. You can see the individual clicks, impressions, CTR, and average position for each page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Use It:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identify Top Pages for a Query:</strong> See which page is the primary landing page for your most important keywords.</li>
            <li><strong>Find Cannibalization Issues:</strong> If multiple pages are competing for the same high-value query, you might want to consolidate your content or clarify the intent of each page.</li>
            <li><strong>Discover Content Gaps:</strong> If a query has high impressions but low clicks, and the ranking pages aren't a great match for the query, it could signal an opportunity to create new, more relevant content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pages to Queries Tab</h2>
        <p>This tab is excellent for understanding the keyword footprint of a specific page and finding opportunities to optimize it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Entry:</strong> Each item is a URL on your site. The badges show the total clicks and impressions for that page from all queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanded View:</strong> When you click on a page, it expands to show a table of all the queries that brought traffic to that page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Use It:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keyword Research for Existing Content:</strong> Discover the full range of queries a page is ranking for. You might find unexpected "long-tail" keywords that you can incorporate into your content to improve its ranking.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimize Page Titles and Headings:</strong> If a page is getting impressions for valuable queries but has a low CTR, consider rewriting your title tags and meta descriptions to better match those queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Linking:</strong> Find pages that rank for relevant terms and add internal links from them to other important pages on your site to pass authority.</li>
        </ul>
