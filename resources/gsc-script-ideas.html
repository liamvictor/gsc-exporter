		<h3>1. Performance Analysis Script</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>What it would do:</strong> This script would go beyond just listing pages and would also fetch key performance metrics like clicks, impressions, click-through rate (CTR), and average position for each page.</li>
			<li><strong>Value:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Identify your best and worst-performing content.</li>
					<li>Discover pages with high impressions but low CTR, which are often good candidates for title and meta description optimization.</li>
					<li>Track ranking changes over time.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>2. Keyword Discovery Script</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>What it would do:</strong> This script would focus on the "query" dimension in GSC to find the keywords that are driving traffic to your site. It could be configured to find keywords for the entire site or for specific pages.</li>
			<li><strong>Value:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Uncover new keyword opportunities.</li>
					<li>Gain a better understanding of the search terms people are using to find your content.</li>
					<li>Identify "striking distance" keywords (e.g., positions 11-20) that could be targeted for a ranking boost.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>3. Sitemap vs. Indexed Pages Comparison Tool</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>What it would do:</strong> This script would compare the URLs listed in your sitemap with the URLs that Google has actually indexed (as reported by GSC).</li>
			<li><strong>Value:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Quickly find "orphan pages" (pages that are indexed but not in your sitemap).</li>
					<li>Identify pages that are in your sitemap but are not being indexed by Google, which could indicate a technical SEO issue.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>4. Automated Anomaly Detection and Alerting</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>What it would do:</strong> This script would run on a schedule (e.g., daily or weekly) to fetch the latest GSC data and compare it to previous periods. It would look for significant changes, such as a sudden drop in traffic, a spike in errors, or a major shift in rankings.</li>
			<li><strong>Value:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Get early warnings of potential problems with your website's performance in search results.</li>
					<li>Proactively address issues before they have a major impact.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>5. Internal Linking Opportunity Finder</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>What it would do:</strong> This script would analyze the top keywords for a given page and then search your site for other pages that mention those keywords.</li>
			<li><strong>Value:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Improve your site's SEO by helping you build a stronger internal linking structure.</li>
					<li>Help distribute "link equity" more effectively throughout your site.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
