        <h1>Merging Forked Repository Changes</h1>
        <p>This document outlines the process for incorporating changes from a forked (or copied) repository into your "parent" repository using a Pull Request (PR).</p>

        <h2>Step 1: You Push Your Changes First</h2>
        <p>Since your local repository is ahead of your <code>main</code> branch on GitHub, you should push your changes first. This ensures the other user can base their work on the absolute latest version of your code.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From your local repository, run:
                <pre><code>git push origin main</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Step 2: Instructions for the Other User</h2>
        <p>The other user needs to update their branch with your latest changes and then open the Pull Request. Please provide them with the following instructions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Add your repository as a remote.</strong> This is a one-time setup that creates a reference to your "parent" repository. They can name it <code>upstream</code>. They must replace <code>&lt;your_repo_url&gt;</code> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
                <pre><code>git remote add upstream &lt;your_repo_url&gt;</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fetch the latest changes from your repository.</strong> This will download the latest commits from your <code>main</code> branch without merging them yet.
                <pre><code>git fetch upstream</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rebase their branch.</strong> This is the most important step. It will take their local commits and re-apply them on top of the latest version of your <code>main</code> branch. This creates a clean, linear history and makes the final merge much simpler.
                <pre><code>git rebase upstream/main</code></pre>
                <p><em>Note: If they encounter any merge conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause and ask them to resolve the conflicts before continuing.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Push the rebased branch to their fork.</strong> Because the history of their <code>main</code> branch was rewritten by the rebase, they will need to perform a "force push". Using <code>--force-with-lease</code> is a safer alternative to <code>--force</code>.
                <pre><code>git push origin main --force-with-lease</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Create the Pull Request.</strong> They should now go to your repository's page on GitHub. GitHub will automatically detect that they pushed a new branch and will show a prominent "Compare & pull request" button. They should click it, review the changes, and submit the PR, ensuring the target is your <code>main</code> branch.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Step 3: You Review and Merge the Pull Request</h2>
        <p>Once the other user has created the Pull Request, you will get a notification.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the <strong>"Pull requests"</strong> tab in your GitHub repository.</li>
            <li>Click on the new PR to review the proposed changes, read their comments, and see a diff of all the code they want to merge.</li>
            <li>If everything looks good, click the <strong>"Merge pull request"</strong> button.</li>
            <li>Finally, pull the newly merged changes down to your local machine so it's fully up-to-date.
                <pre><code>git pull origin main</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This workflow is the standard for collaboration on GitHub and ensures that you have full control over what gets added to your repository.</p>
