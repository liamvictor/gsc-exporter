This report provides a multi-dimensional summary of a site's performance for a single period.

### 1. Overall Performance Summary
* **Clicks & Impressions**: Establish the absolute traffic and visibility baseline.
* **Average CTR**: High-level indicator of search snippet relevance and clickability.
* **Average Position**: The weighted average ranking position across all query impressions.

### 2. Top Pages by Clicks & Impressions
* Identify your **Top Traffic Drivers** (high clicks) and **Brand Visibility Leaders** (high impressions).
* A page with high impressions but low clicks indicates a major click-through rate optimization opportunity.

### 3. High Impressions, Low CTR Opportunities
* Lists pages with **>= 1,000 impressions** and **< 1% CTR**.
* **Actionable Insight**: These pages are highly visible in search results but fail to attract clicks. Prioritise them for search snippet optimization (rewriting title tags, improving meta descriptions, and adding structured schema).

### 4. Performance by Device
* **Mobile vs. Desktop vs. Tablet**: Evaluate the mobile-friendliness of your site. If mobile impressions are high but CTR/Position is low, check mobile page speed, rendering, and content presentation.

### 5. Performance by Country
* Analyse geographic traffic distribution. Useful for identifying international expansion opportunities or localising content for top-performing regions.""",

    "period_comparison_report": """## How to Interpret the Period Comparison Report

This report tracks performance changes between a current period and a previous period of equal length.

### 1. Interactive Charts
* Visualise query-level deltas to quickly distinguish broad traffic changes from page-specific fluctuations.

### 2. Query Deltas (Clicks & Impressions)
* **Positive Delta (+)**: Marks search terms that have gained visibility and clicks ("Rising Stars").
* **Negative Delta (-)**: Highlights search terms that have lost traction ("Decaying Keywords").

### 3. Position Deltas
* **Negative Delta (-)**: Represents a positive change (ranking moved closer to position 1).
* **Positive Delta (+)**: Indicates ranking slippage.

### 4. Content Decay & Opportunity Analysis
* Sort by click delta descending to find the biggest winners.
* Sort by click delta ascending to locate decaying pages/queries that require content updates or backlink acquisition.
* Focus on queries with stable or rising impressions but falling clicks—this indicates a drop in snippet relevance or increased competitor ad spend.""",

    "keyword_cannibalisation_report": """## How to Interpret the Keyword Cannibalisation Report

Keyword cannibalisation occurs when multiple pages on your site compete for the same search query.

### 1. Identifying Competitor Pages
* Look for queries where multiple URLs rank with similar average positions.
* If a query lists multiple ranking URLs with split clicks, it indicates search engines are confused about which page is most relevant.

### 2. Assessing the Impact
* **Diluted Authority**: Link equity and click-through rates are split across pages.
* **Rank Fluctuations**: Search engines may constantly alternate which page ranks, causing position instability.

### 3. Actions to Resolve Cannibalisation
* **Canonicalisation**: Set the canonical tag of the weaker page to point to the primary page if they serve the same intent.
* **301 Redirects**: Redirect the redundant page to the primary page and merge their content.
* **De-optimisation**: Remove the target keyword from the metadata and headings of the secondary page.
* **Content Restructuring**: Re-write the pages to target distinct search intents (e.g. informational vs. transactional).""",

    "page_level_report": """## How to Interpret the Page Level Report

A page-centric view of performance focusing on organic traffic distribution and query complexity.

### 1. Unique Query Counts (Query #)
* **Long-Tail Depth**: Pages with a high number of unique queries are successfully capturing long-tail search traffic.
* **Narrow Intent**: Pages with high clicks but a low unique query count typically rank highly for a single, high-volume keyword.

### 2. Traffic Skew
* Typically, 20% of your pages drive 80% of your traffic. Use this report to verify if traffic is diversified or heavily reliant on a single landing page.
* Check pages with high unique queries but low clicks—they may require small content expansions to move long-tail rankings from page 2 to page 1.""",

    "search_appearance_report": """## How to Interpret the Search Appearance Report

Segment your performance metrics by Google Rich Result types (e.g. Review Snippets, FAQs, Videos, AMP, Products).

### 1. Rich Result Efficiency
* Compare CTRs of search appearances against standard web search. Rich results generally exhibit significantly higher CTR.

### 2. Schema Markup Verification
* If you deployed Structured Data (e.g. Product or FAQ Schema) but see zero impressions for that type, your schema may be invalid or not yet indexed by Google.
* Use this report to calculate the direct traffic ROI of your structured data implementation efforts.""",

    "discover_key_performance_metrics": """## How to Interpret the Google Discover Report

Google Discover is a query-less feed based on user interests rather than search intent.

### 1. Volatility and Spikes
* Discover traffic is notoriously spike-heavy and short-lived. Expect rapid impression surges followed by steep declines.

### 2. High CTR Expectations
* Discover CTRs are often much higher than standard organic web CTR (often 5% to 15%+).
* Analyse high-performing Discover topics to identify content themes that resonate with your target audience's interest feed.""",

    "sitemap_generator": """## How to Interpret the Sitemap Generator Report

This tool discovers active URLs based on GSC historical query data and outputs a search-validated XML sitemap.

### 1. Active vs. Orphaned URLs
* Compares URLs in GSC that received impressions/clicks against your internal database.
* Identifies "active" pages that Google is currently crawling and serving.

### 2. Crawl Budget Efficiency
* Sitemap files generated from search-validated URLs ensure Google prioritises crawls on pages that actually generate search visibility, optimizing your crawl budget.
* Exclude low-impression, low-value pages to prevent Google from wasting crawl resources.""",

A macro-level dashboard tracking site health and search type distribution over a 16-month period.

### 1. Seasonal Trends
* Spot year-over-year (YoY) changes, holiday dips, or quarterly industry trends.

### 2. Search Type Distribution
* Segment traffic across **Web, Image, Video, and News** search.
* Identify if image search or video search is a major traffic contributor, which warrants additional media optimization.

### 3. Historical Trajectory
* Assess whether SEO strategies are yielding long-term compound growth or if site-wide visibility is in decline.""",

    "query_position_analysis": """## How to Interpret the Query Position Analysis Report

Tracks how your keywords are distributed across different ranking groups over time.

### 1. Position Buckets
* Monitors the count and trend of keywords ranking in:
  * **Top 3**: Primary traffic drivers.
  * **Positions 4-10**: Page 1 visibility; prime candidates for optimization to push into Top 3.
  * **Positions 11-20**: Page 2 visibility; requires content improvements or link additions to reach page 1.
  * **Positions 21-100**: Long-tail or low-relevance queries.

### 2. Trend Identification
* If Top 3 keywords are declining while Positions 11-20 are increasing, it indicates site-wide ranking deflation or increased competitor activity.""",

* **Average Position**: The average ranking position of your URLs for the queries. A lower position (closer to 1) is better. Monitor position trends to spot algorithm updates or competitor improvements."""

## Expected Output Files

This report generates the following files in the output directory:

        for o in outputs:
            content += f"* {o}\n"

        content += f"""

## Recommendations and Best Practices

1. **Warm the Cache First**: Run `python utilities/cache_warmer.py --file site-lists/sites.txt` to populate GSC data locally before executing batch reports.
2. **Frequency**: Generate this report monthly to identify seasonal trends and monitor organic visibility performance.
3. **Bespoke Branding**: Custom logo, primary colours, and support links can be configured in `config/branding.json`.
